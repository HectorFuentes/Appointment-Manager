# Appointment-Manager
Fall Demo

This is the github repository for the Hector Fuentes appointment manager

This build is of an android app (.apk) which can be found in the android builds folder

This project consists of .php files which are hosted at my website hectorfuentes.infinityfreeapp.com

This website has a mySQL database which has a table for the admin login, and a table for the appointments

The admin login table contains the admin usename and the encrypted version of the admin password

To log into the admin account from the client the client needs to hash the correct password before passing it to the database

The appointments table contains all the appointment info and has an incrimenting primary key of the appointments ID

The .php files to access the database are located in the website folder

The app was created using Unity3D

All the files needed to develop the Unity3D app along with the C# code backend are contained in the App folder
